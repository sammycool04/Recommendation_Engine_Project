# Recommendation_Engine_Project
This is a project uses IBM Watson Studio dataset to create recommendation algorithm for users. There are four parts in this project

***I. Exploratory Data Analysis

*Examine distribution of articles a user interacts within the dataset and provide a visual and descriptive statistics.

***II. Rank Based Recommendations

*Provide two functions to get n top articles names and n top articles ids.

***III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering Function create_user_item_matrix: reformat the df dataframe to be shaped with users as the rows and articles as the columns.

*Each user should only appear in each row once.
*Each article should only show up in one column.
*If a user has interacted with an article, then place a 1 where the user-row meets for that article-column. It does not matter how many times a user has interacted with the article, all entries where a user has interacted with an article should be a 1.
*If a user has not interacted with an item, then place a zero where the user-row meets for that article-column
***V. Matrix Factorization Build use matrix factorization to make article recommendations to the users on the IBM Watson Studio platform
